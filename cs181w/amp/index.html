<h2 id="342015hacktivism">3/4/2015 - Hacktivism</h2>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Three Approaches
<ol><li>Try to change the law within the system</li>
<li>Break the law and accept the penalties</li>
<li>Break the law and avoid the penalties</li></ol></li>
<li>Aaron Schwartz - wrote a python script to open source JSTOR articles arguing that information should be free and not restricted to universities who pay exoribant fees</li>
<li>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986):</li>
<li>"Terms of Service" in these applications often included fine print that many people didn't read</li>
<li>Socretes - argues that if you break a law, you have to accept the penalties so that when the law is changed, people will accept the social contract and abide by that new law</li>
</ul>

<p>Three examples of the approaches above: <br>
<strong>WikiLeaks:</strong></p>

<p>Julian Assange - broke the law and not facing consequences</p>

<ul>
<li>Posted confidential information through WikiLeaks that exposed a lot of friendly foreign agents that were helping the US. </li>
<li>currently holed up in Ecaudorian embassy in Sweden</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Snowden:</strong></p>

<p>Released information about PRISM contradictory to what Congress publicly stated. Currently in Russia, where he has stated that he will return to the States and abide by the penalities after the policies surrounding his circumstance changes.</p>

<p><strong>Anonymous:</strong></p>

<p>Group of people based out of 4chan, an anonymous forum. Where they took it upon themselves to break the law without facing the consequences.</p>

<p><strong>SOPA Blackout</strong></p>

<p>A shining example of trying to change the law within the system. Aaron Schwartz before he died rallied a lot of the world's most popular websites in support of retracting the online piracy act that was achieved with a 100-person swing.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Digital Divide:
<ul><li>Women percentage for CS graduates decreased from 13.8% to 11.7% </li>
<li>We're at 33% declared, 27% graduating class (Stanford is on the rise...)</li>
<li>Minority CS Graduation: 2010-2011 rates indicate that African-Americans and Hispanics are less than 4%</li></ul></li>
<li>Unlocking the Clubhouse (15 years ago) a study on why women were less than 1/10 in CS grad</li>
<li>Why Diversity is Important?
<ul><li>We need to focus on the problem of access a an important ethical principle</li></ul></li>
<li><p>What makes CS different?</p>

<ul><li>Experience in computer use prior to college differs markedly with gender, cultural, and socioeconomic differences</li>
<li>Flexibility of software allows computers to reflect their cultural environments more strongly than other technologies</li>
<li>Differences in individual productivity are more pronounced </li></ul></li>
<li><p>Cooper: Increasing diversity in South America for the tech industry.</p></li>

<p><strong>Announcements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Krister is the guest lecturer today</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Video:</strong> describing how drones are able to act as surveillance machines to prevent crime </li>
<li><p>Privacy vs. Safety (Government)</p>

<ul><li>How do we know whether the Government is actually providing us Safety?</li>
<li>Thomas Hobbes - <em>State of Nature</em> 
<ul><li>Imagine a society without any government at all</li>
<li>Life is solitary, brutish, and chaotic with everyone on edge</li>
<li>Proposed voluntary gathering under a soverign - gaurentees some degree of safety</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><p>Privacy vs. (some service) Novelty (Business)</p></li>
<li><strong>Video:</strong> Proposes that cyberwarfare may be the new battleground for the new century. NSA works to listen for trouble</li>
<li>Locksian society</li>
<li>Right to privacy not an explicit right in the Constitution
<ul><li>only implicitly implied had set precedent in 1960s</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Critiques of Privacy and Security in the context of Government</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Concerned that people who are "soverign" are themselves human - can they be trusted with this type of power?  </li>
<li>CEO of Sun Microsystems: "You don't have any privacy anyways get over it!" Because of technology, it's not possible to exist on a private spectrum anymore  </li>
<li>"If we aren't doing anything wrong, what purpose do you have in surveying us?" (counter: how do we know that you're not doing wrong unless we're surveying you?)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Critiques of Privacy and Business</strong></p>

<p><strong>Video:</strong> Watched a paradody video that imagines when Facebook was working with NSA to curate data and store
<strong>Video:</strong> Watched another video satirizing what would happen if Google just shut down</p>

<ul>
<li>How much do we actually have a choice in keeping our data private? </li>
<li>80% of us go with the default according to an organ donorship study (opt-in vs. opt-out for organ donorship) so isn't it important what the default for our privacy settings are?</li>
<li>Is the internet a public utility? </li>
<li>Terms and Services at these tech companies by default allow a broader scope than it actually needs/uses</li>
</ul>

<li>Cyber trust
<ul><li>NSF Cyber Trust program promotes society where trust enables technologies to support needs without violating confidence or exacerbating public risks</li></ul></li>
<li>Data breach
<ul><li>Violating trust by giving access to data that isn't intended  </li></ul></li>
<li>Privacy
<ul><li>"a home is your castle" the English right to have privacy for what you own</li>
<li>not as well defined as identity theft</li>
<li>"the right to be left alone" or "the right to stay out of the public view"</li>
<li>from an information perpsective - you control your own information.</li>
<li>Privacy refers to records held by third parties (e.g. doctor has health information about me, etc...) </li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1966 - Freedom of Information Act</li>
<li>1974 - Privacy Act: you've got to keep personally identifiable information private</li>
<li>1974 - FERPA: protection of records held by school</li>
<li>1996 - HIPAA: medical records held by a hospital</li>
<li>1998 - Idenity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>State data breach disclosure laws</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ways to limit data breach
<ul><li>Restrict Access</li>
<li>Log access to it</li>
<li>Inform people who have data, can have data breached</li>
<li>what is the level of encryption of the data itself - what would be adquate protection for the data?</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>US statuatory laws present 45 different ways of encrypting? risk? (sorry didn't catch this point) </li></ul></li>
<li>Policy analysis - alternate configs
<ul><li>variaitons of existing laws using incremental approaches to fine-tune laws</li></ul></li>
<li>Policy Analysis - collective choice
<ul><li>using market forces to limit data breach</li>
<li>the market would force companies to protect data better when companies lose trust and value when their data is breached</li>
<li>problem: will individuals punish companies that allow data to be breached? Or will individuals view companies as victims (e.g. Samsung)</li></ul></li>
<li>Are the assumptions about information regulation reasonable?
<ul><li>Do customers value data security <em>over convenience</em>? (It's not possible for organizations to do anything about if data is breached - will an university just shut down if all of its students' information is breached?</li></ul></li>

<li>A perosn who enjoys learning details of compute rsystems and how to stretch their coapabilities</li>
<li>A person who programs enthusiasticaly</li>
<li>A person good at programming quickly</li>
<li><em>Unfortunately</em>, press has ruined the term "hacking"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>History of Hacking</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1971: "freaking" was whistling a "Captain Crunch" toy to spoof a long-distance calls</li>
<li>1982: John Shoch and Jon Hupp thought of using worm programs to go into computers at night when people aren't using them for distributed computing on complex problems</li>
<li>1983: <em>WarGames</em> this movie depicts a character tha gains access to the military's nuclear command system</li>
<li>1984: A group of Milwaukee teenagers (414's) begins a series of break-ins.</li>
<li>1986: First PC virus released (at a conference)</li>
<li>1987: "Captain Midnight" 
<ul><li>People used to mooch off of HBO's signal by buying some parts from RadioShack and listening to a frequency.</li>
<li>"Captain Midnight" shows up on the frequency and refuses to let HBO scramble the signal</li></ul></li>
<li>1990: quite recent that there's nothing wrong with hacking.</li>
<li>Now: CERT Incident Report lists 100,000's of hacks a day</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Viruses</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a program that inserts itself into one or more files and then performs some action (action can be null)</li>
<li>Types: Macro, polymorphic, latent, etc...</li>
<li>Worms
<ul><li>Distinction from viruses able to replicate and run on their own</li>
<li>Most famous: Robert Morris Jr.'s worm</li></ul></li>
<li>Internet Worm: <code>debug</code> option in Unix <code>sendmail</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other Attacks</strong>
* FingerD Attack if the user enters a namestirng that overflows the buffer, when the function returns - it jumps into the code written as part of its name. executing the worm's instructions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trojan Horse - putting up a fake front to steal data from your victim</p>

<ul><li>Ken Thompson says you can't protect against Trojan Horse backdoor attacks unless you do everything yourself</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Zero-day attacks: Built-in vulnerability that people aren't aware of. Black market offers money in exchange of vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li>DDos Attacks</li>
<li>Logic bombs: a progrma that violates a security policy when an external event occurs
<ul><li>disgrunted employee leaves a 'bomb' in a program that can only disabled with a code</li>
<li>reveals identity...</li></ul></li>

<li>Social engineering - popularized by Kevin Mitnick 
<ul><li>exploiting human links</li>
<li>pretexting (making a story)</li>
<li>phishing (send you a website that looks legit but steals)</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is Hacking Good?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can lead to awareness of a system's vulnerabilities and allows for defenses to be prepared (pentesting - penetration testing)</li>
<li>can lead to availability of information - e.g. social proection</li>
<li>GNU manifesto <br>
<ul><li>information wants to be free</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is Hacking Bad?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You can explain vulnerabilities without breaking into it</li>
<li>If all info is free, there's no privacy</li>
<li>Complete government transparency isn't always good</li>
<li>Social protection leads agencies to increased security</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Random people to now</strong></p>

<ul>

<p><strong>What is IP?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What is physical property?
<ul><li>something tangible. something you can own and</li></ul></li>
<li>But ideas aren't tangible - something about the value of the idea is associated with the idea of sharing it with others</li>
<li>IP can be replicated or replicated</li>
<li><em>From a utilitarian perspective</em>: If we create a "right" to IP, we should protect it based on our dedication to maintaining the value of IP for everyone.</li>
<li>Act-based vs. rule-based utilitarians:
<ul><li>What if we have IP that can be detrimental to everyone? Should we protect it? </li>
<li>Sometimes it depends on the IP itself</li></ul></li>
<li>John Locke</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Foundations of intellectual property protection in the US</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Constitutional Basis</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Invetors the exclusive Right to their discoveries</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Technology and social conventions both affect conventions</p></li>
<li>Tension: Technology has made it easier to <em>replicate</em> and <em>dissiminate</em> information</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Copyright Law</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Awarded to an author for a work that is: original, non-functional, and fixed in a tangible medium</li>
<li>Right to Fair Use: Given that I can buy software, what's stopping me from reverse-engineering it?</li>
<li>You can't buy software, you <strong>license</strong> it. </li>
<li>When you"I agree to the Terms and Conditions" you are promising to not dissemble and disseminate the technology.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patents</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Created by the Statute of Monopolies in 1624</li>
<li>Design, utility, and plant patents exist</li>
<li>the terms are "useful" "novel" and "nonobvious"</li>
<li>Copyright doesn't cover "derivative works"</li>
<li>requires "disclosure", though people tend to obfuscate exactly what they're trying to disclose</li>
<li>current protection is for 20 years</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trademarks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Foundation is in common law against unfair competition</li>
<li>Word, name, phrase, or symbol. (typically referring to a service)</li>
<li>Protection continues as along as product is sold (becuase people assocate the name with the product)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trade Secrets</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Protections established in state law</li>
<li>Most states now subscribe to the Uniform Trade Secrets Act</li>
<li>Protection continues as long as secret is maintained</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Protecting mere ideas</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Buchwald vs. Paramounte Pictures - a successful victory to reclaim mere ideas as intellectual property</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Software Patent Cases</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Gottschalk v. Benson (1972): Found that software is an idea and not patentable  </li>
<li>Diamond v. Diehr (1981): Established patentability of software in certain cases. <strong>Not</strong> algorithms, because these are ideas which are part of nature  </li>
<li>In re Iwashi (1992): Only a special subset of algorithms are patentable</li>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tragedy of the Commons: </p>

<ul><li>see Cooper's sheep grazing depiction - made famous from Hardin's argument against the 1960s USSR arms race)</li>
<li>classic example: overfishing</li>
<li>actually from 1652: Gerard Winstanley and the Diggers </li>
<li>Why related to computing? Here are some related examples
<ol><li>Internet speeds and throughput</li>
<li>Virtual stores vs. brick-and-mortar stores</li>
<li>Personal Privacy </li>
<li>Open-Source software - everybody wants to use them but nobody wants to supply + maintain them</li>
<li>Labor (Google - there's nowhere to move up, but are you intellectually challenged? stealing talent where talented labor is the commons)</li></ol></li></ul></li>
<li><p>Prisoner's Dilemma</p>

<ul><li>repeated simulations point out that the best policy is to actually testify against your partner</li>
<li>Example: with Cable - if you have an agreement with other companies to hike up prices, everybody gains exactly                                                                       </li>
<li>Anti-trust: Four VCs battle for foursqur=are</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Offshoring</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Globalization + offsoring is slated to increase, but it will continue to be a problem as tech companies try to do more with less people.</li>
<li>Customer support is running into a similar problem, with the additional complication of requiring english as a language</li>
<li>Developed countries need to adopt policies to foster inovation. To educate and attract the best IT talent, US grad schools still wins.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Economic Realities related to software</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Economies of Scale: you can sell products for less dependent on the amount of people using it</li>
<li>Network effect: value of product grows in direct proportion to number of users</li>
<li>Customer lock-in: cost of changing software systems is huge</li>
<li>Low distribution: you just download it (essentially free to duplicate - development costs are distributed across a larger base, so big players have a huge advantage)</li>
<li>The most productive programmers are in high demand, but short supply</li>
<li>High-cost effectiveness: software can still be effective even with bugs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Philosophy of economics</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Globalization may cause overall decrease in happiness if some people are overworked for more utility</li>

<p><strong>Why Computer ethics vs. applied ethics vs. engineering ethics?</strong></p>

<ul><li>unique ethical issues that would not have existed if computer technology had not been invented.</li>
<li>Proposes that the problem of a field overflowing (Y2K bug, the Unix timestamp problem of 2038) is unique to technology</li>
<li>Uniquely cheap, uniquely cloned (ripping or burning music), </li></ul></li>
<li><p>Deborah Johnson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computers pose new versions of standard moral problems and moral dilemmas, exacerabating the old problems and forcing us to apply ordinary moral norms in uncharted realms</p>

<ul><li>Classical Foundations by Aristotle by <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em></li>
<li>Virtuous, Kindness, Honesty, Respect, Integrity (attributes we want people to have)</li></ul></li>
<li><p>3 different philosophical approaches:</p></li>
<li><p>Virtue (Aristotle, Confucius)  </p></li>
<li>Deontological (Kant, many religions)  </li>
<li><p>Consequentialist (utilitarianism)  </p>

<ul><li>one consequence to meet: minimizing the gap between the rich and the poor</li>
<li>heathens and dolers</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Classical ethics (aristotle)</strong></p>

<ul><li>Based on virtue</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Deontological Theories (Kant)</strong></p>

<ul><li>Actions are intrinsically right or wrong (do not depend on the conseuqence</li>
<li>Telos: Goal or end.</li>
<li>The rightness or wrongness of an action depends</li>
<li>Deon comes from <em>duty</em></li>
<li>Religions come from this belief - introduces rules of behavior</li>
<li><strong>Kant's Categorial Imerpative</strong>: Don't treat people as a means to an end.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consequentialist theories (Mill's Utilitarianism)</strong></p>

<ul><li><p>Actions are right as long as they maximize happiness</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the greatest good to the greatest number of people which is the measure of right and wrong</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Bentham: <code>utils = hedons - dolors</code> can measure utility</p></li>
<li>Mill: abandoned mathematical structure but used utilitarianism as a decision making tool.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Nature of Software Failures</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Normal Accidents by Charles Perrow
<ul><li>Doesn't focus specifically on programming, but raises issues critical to understanding why complex systems fail</li></ul></li>
<li>Coupling and Interaction Level
<ul><li>If we plot coupling vs. the number of interactions, the worst problem is to have tightly coupled systems (where one change is important enough to change a lot of elements downstream of it) that a ton of people have to interact with.</li>
<li>The worst ones to be is to be like a nuclear plant where tightly coupled problems are also problems that many people interact with</li>
<li>Software is definitely up there in the top right </li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Critical Observations about Software</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Exceeding complexity makes software intrinsically difficult and not likely to change</li>
<li>Individual software developers differe remarkdably: short supply and difficulties in identify good engineers.</li>
<li>Direction of computing is not controlled solely by technological innovation. Economic, social, and political factors all play a role.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Discovering Debugging</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Grace Murray Hopper - found an actual bug in vaccum tubes during her time at Harvard</li>
<li><p>Maurice Wilkes - developed EDSAC and the concept of microprocessing. Won the second ever Turing Award for his work to store programs internally into a computer (before, we had punchcards to detail what steps in JCL, job control language, the computer should take).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as we started programming, we found to
  our surprise that it wasn’t as easy to get programs
  right as we had thought. Debugging had to be
  discovered. I can remember the exact instant when
  I realized that a large part of my life from then on
  was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my
  own programs.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Christopher Strachey - Father of domain theory</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although programming techniques have improved immensely
  since the early days, the process of finding and correcting errors <br>
  in programming known graphically—if inelegantly—as <br>
  debugging still remains a most difficult, confused and <br>
  unsatisfactory operation. . . . Although we are happy to pay lipservice to the adage that to err is human, most of us like to make a small private reservation about our own performance on special occasions when we really try. It is somewhat deflating to be shown publicly and incontrovertibly by a machine that even <br>
  when we do try, we in fact make just as many mistakes as other <br>
  people. If your pride cannot recover from this blow, you will <br>
  never make a programm</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>David L Parnas (important programmer after Fred Brooks)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People familiar with both software engineering and older
  engineering disciplines observe that the state of the art in <br>
  software is significantly behind that in other areas of engineering. When most engineering products have been completed, tested, and sold, it is reasonable to expect that the product design is correct and that it will work reliably. With software products, it is usual to find that the software has major “bugs” and does not work reliably for some users.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Gerald Weinberg (40 years ago):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although one does not find errors by a detailed search of each line, word, or character, the ability to get down to details is essential in the end. Thus, for debugging, an almost complementary set of mental powers is needed. No wonder good debuggers are so rare!</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Software Complexities - No Silver Bullet</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Essential Difficulties: Complexity of software systems, people don't know what they want, invisibility of software</li>
<li>Accidental Difficulties: difficulties that attenuate its production but are not inherent to software itself</li>
<li>Accidental Difficulties: things like </li>
<li>Mythical Man Month - how much code a man canIn write in a month</li>
<li><p>Brook's Law: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Intel's "Parallel Gamble" they're trying to add more microprocessor to a chip, but nobody programms effectively in parallel.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Economics and software development</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Low distribution costs: essentially free to duplicate and distribute. Big players can have a distinct advantage.</li>
<li>Network Externalities: value increases with number of people using that software</li>
<li>Shortage of highly skilled labor: most productive programmers are in high demand but low supply</li>
<li>High cost-effectiveness: remarkably useful even if bugs exist</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong>
In preparation of writing about bugs, let's look at two famous bugs:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Therac-25</em>: a machine produced by Atomic Energy Commission Limited (AECL) of Canada for radiation-therapy: <br>
<ul><li>3 people died from radiation overdose...</li>
<li>A request for hardware safety locks  </li>
<li>Error message discovered: <code>Malfunction 54</code></li>
<li>Absence of process to report software incidents</li>
<li>Overconfidence in the software and the removal of hardware interlocks made software vulnerable...</li>
<li><strong>Lessons learned:</strong> documentation shouldn't be afterthought, software quality + standards needed, designs should be simple, software should be subjected to extensive testing</li></ul></li>
<li><em>Ariane 4</em> Floating point number was converted to a value too big to be held by a 16 bit integer. The computer shut off, and the error logs paralyzed even the backup computer as well which was catastrophic for the engine. <br>
<ul><li><strong>Lesons Learned:</strong> Handling of catastrophic failures should be better, Better software reviews</li></ul></li>
</ol>

<li>RFIDs were recorded after class as well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WIRED article</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Top information security threats we will face in 2015</li>
<li>Fun fact: Congress didn't even know about NSA until 1970s</li>
<li>National-State attacks:
<ul><li>NSA + GCHQ  (Britian) attacked a Belgium telecomunications company</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a>: virus that attacked national centrifuges</li></ul></li>
<li>Extortion:
<ul><li>Sony hacked with the threat of releasing sensitive information about personal/private lives of actors</li></ul></li>
<li>Data Destruction</li>
<li>Bank Card Breaches</li>
<li>Third-Party Breaches</li>
<li>Critical Infrastructure
<ul><li>Opening all the bridges in New York from China</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why is information security important?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cooper argues employees are the most important asset to a company, but <strong>data</strong> comes second</li>
<li>Intellectual property has enormous value to a company </li>
<li>We need remote access to information these days: advances in networking means that data is more accessible than ever</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Legal definition of "information security"</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Protecting information and information systems from unauturhozied access in order to provide:
<ol><li>Integrity: fraud, tampering (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tylenol_murders">Chicago Tylenol murders</a>)</li>
<li>Confidentiality: </li>
<li>Availability</li></ol></li>
<li>Information Security, Computer Security, Cybersecurity, Information Assurance are all used interchangeably by US Departments</li>
<li>Authentication - is the sender/receiver allowed to send or receive data?</li>
<li>Non-repudiation - sender/receiver cannot deny sending or receiving the data</li>
<li>Examples of violating:
<ul><li>Availability - DDOS attacks</li>
<li>Integrity - changing database values (hacking)</li>
<li>Non-repudiation - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks</li>
<li>Confidentiality - WikiLeaks </li>
<li>Authentication - Phishing attacks</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional terms</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cryptography - most common way to ensure confidentiality. Even if stolen, still retains its confidentiality</li>
<li>Vulnerability - a hole or weakness in the system. Vulnerabilities can be exploited.</li>
<li>Threat - danger that can exploit the vulnerability to do harm
<ol><li>Disclosure - unauthorized access to information</li>
<li>Deception - acceptance of false data</li>
<li>Disruption - tampering with availability, taking control of a system</li>
<li>Usurptation - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep">Firesheep</a> allowed people to usurp identity by intercepting traffic and stealing session information </li></ol></li>
<li>Risk - likelihood that something bad is going to happen</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aims of Security</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prevention - prevent attackers from violating security policy</li>
<li>Detection - detect attackers' violation of security policy</li>
<li>Recovery - stop attack, asess, and repair damage</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Levels of Information Security</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Application (most common)</li>
<li>Operating System</li>
<li>The network</li>
<li>Data management system</li>
<li>Physical protection of devices</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to implement information security?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Confidentiality - ACL (access control lists) to access files</li>
<li>Integrity - check for semantic integrity to ensure inputs are reasonable. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5">Ariane 5 accident</a> which didn't check for reasonable rocket thrust values</li>
<li>Non-repudiation - usually verified through logs</li>
<li>User Authentication - two-step authentication: two mechanisms to validate identity</li>
<li>Information authentication - signature mechanisms</li>
<li>Intrusion detection</li>
<li>Security Policy, mechanism (enforce policies), and assurance (knowing that policy + mechanism are being followed)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Management and Legal Issues</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is it cost-effective to prevent (usually more expensive) or recover</li>
<li>Models determine damage projected and how we should protect this information</li>
<li>Laws and Customs - are desired security measures illegal or culturally acceptable?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Human Factor Issues</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The weakest link happens to be human - social engineering to get passwords</li>
<li>Outsiders tailgating into Google, Palantir</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Thought Questions for Today</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What's the relationship between computing and information security? Which is a subset of which?  </li>
<li>Should information security ethics need to be viewed as a separate field than computing ethics?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Brief History of CS181:</strong></p>

<p>Why do we talk about ethics in Computer Science?</p>

<ul>
<li>Robert Taylor Morris Jr.
<ul><li>Shut down 25% of the internet with a worm</li>
<li>Led CS departments to be more proactive about educating students about ethics</li></ul></li>
<li>Terry Winograd's Address about this course
<ul><li>Described why he created this course (CS181)</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Three Views of Computer Ethics</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The Angel-Devil Depiction <br>
<ul><li>There's an absolute good and bad</li>
<li>Some part of you wants to do the bad</li>
<li>You need to exert moral strength to overcome this impulse and do what is right.</li></ul></li>
<li>Morality Computer <br>
<ul><li>There's a way to sum up all of the relevant factors </li>
<li>You can quantify good and bad - there's a set of morale rules that determine the goodness and badness</li>
<li>Assume that you'll do the right thing if it's decided as so</li>
<li>Problems: 
<ul><li>The algorithm is subjective - humanity doesn't agree on the grounds for moral reasoning</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Troupe of Jugglers <br>
<ul><li>Balancing motivations to make spur-of-the moment decisions that other people depend on</li>
<li>Social context of the activity defines the impact that your decisions have on other people</li>
<li>Accepted ways of juggling change over time </li></ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What Makes Computing Difficult</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The discipline of software engineering has not had centuries in which to mature
<ul><li>Software Engineering first used as a term in 1968</li></ul></li>
<li>Computing is used to solve hard problems</li>
<li>Software has high "system complexity"</li>
<li>Economics gravitate towards flawed systems
<ul><li>Ability of getting huge market share (GOOG, MFST) means that people don't really care about the bugs</li></ul></li>
<li>Bugs are ubiquitous and inevitable</li>
<li>Inherently chaotic - small changes initially generate massive changes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Thought Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What public-policy issues involving computing do you feel to prove important over the next few decades?</li>
</ol>
