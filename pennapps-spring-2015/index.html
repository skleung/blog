            <p>A running commentary of antics at PennApps Spring 2015.</p>

<h4 id="friday">Friday</h4>

<p><strong>6:00am</strong></p>

<p>Met a Stanford freshman who was on the same flight - made our collective ways over to campus from the airport. No ticket stations at the platform, but SEPTA rail operators have exact change for cash - public transportation <em>giving</em> exact change is a new one for me.</p>

<p><strong>6:40am:</strong></p>

<p>Just got on UPenn's campus, grabbed a quick breakfast from a food cart just off 33rd and Smith. </p>

<p><strong>7:30am:</strong></p>

<p>So UPenn's wi-fi is not exactly readily available to visitors. Looks like Van Pelt doesn't open until 8:30am either, so it looks like I'll hanging out in this Cosi cafe for a while until the library opens...</p>

<p><strong>10:30am</strong></p>

<p>Toured the UPenn engineering quad, and ate at Bui's sandwich truck</p>

<p><strong>2:00pm</strong></p>

<p>At PennApps Health. <br>
<strong>Visualization and healthcare?</strong></p>

<p>What if we apply visualization to schedulers in the hospital (pigeonholing the number of patients who need treatment into the limited number of rooms in a hospital)</p>

<p><strong>Iron Triangle</strong></p>

<p>Healthcare is suffering from a fingers-pointing problem that prevents anybody from taking responsibility for supporting innovative technologies. Prototypes for low-hanging fruit suffer in user adoption because no one wants to take responsibility for paying for it. It's an formidable problem that's keeping innovation from making it past these interlocking gates of healthcare. Elliot Menschik suggests two solutions: <br>
1. Focus on a target audience that removes the complexity from the equation (e.g. conceierge doctors that are able to develop a customer experience for their patients) <br>
2. Take one side of this triangle that suffers from excessive overhead, and convince the other two sides of the triangle how painfully obvious it is to adopt this newer point on the triangle (e.g. Oscar)</p>

<p><strong>Collective Health</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hioscar.com/">oscar</a> for companies as mentioned by William Motley.</p>

<p><strong>6:19pm</strong></p>

<p>Opening Ceremony kicks off! <br>
Notable APIs: Postmates, Sension, Comcast's geocaching</p>

<p><strong>7:50pm</strong></p>

<p>Waited in the hardware line for a long while to grab their heaviest items - 2 $2000 monitors!</p>

<p><strong>8:45pm</strong></p>

<p>Got our monitors and finally settled down to hack! Now, what are we buildling...</p>

<p><strong>11:30pm</strong></p>

<p>Settled on an idea. Now a name...Selfie Hero?</p>

<p><strong>7:30am</strong></p>

<p>Woke up, got some breakfast, and a blanket!</p>

<h4 id="saturday">Saturday</h4>

<p><strong>1:15pm</strong></p>

<p>Had lunch, then did a major product pivot after talking with a mentor...</p>

<p><strong>2:00pm</strong></p>

<p>Finally talking technical begins</p>

<p><strong>2:20pm</strong></p>

<p>Hacking begins! We got a guy on the backend, a guy on design, and two on frontend.</p>

<p><strong>3:04pm</strong></p>

<p>Front-end set up, <a href="http://coffeescript.carbonfive.com/">learning coffeescript</a>.</p>

<p><strong>6:00pm</strong></p>

<p>Chugging along. Logo's designed, frontend is up, and server is rockin'</p>

<p><strong>1:00am</strong></p>

<p>Working on sorting and interfacing with the server we set up. The app is now successfully ported over to a native iPhone app wrapper.</p>

<p><strong>9:30am</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://pennapps2015w.challengepost.com/submissions/31493-snappo">Submission</a> time! And now it's time for demos :)</p>

<p><strong>1:00pm</strong></p>

<p>Super impressed with the quality of the hacks this year, wow - what a great bunch of projects to be a part of. Definitely impressed with the amount of hard data and good hacking went into some of the top hacks :)</p>
