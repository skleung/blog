        <section class="post-content">
            <p>The past few months have truly been a whirlwind of decisions for the upcoming year and beyond. Since starting the search for full-time opportunities last September, deciding instead to <a href="http://shermanleung.com/blog/mse-masters">finish a master's degree</a>, and restarting the search for internships, I've decided to join <a href="https://www.mangohealth.com">Mango Health</a> as a KPCB fellow this coming summer!</p>

<p>As I've come to a decision, I've had some time to think about what I value in a career opportunity at this point in my life. I wanted to take this time to reflect and share what I've learned about myself and offer some reasons for choosing Mango that parallel a <a href="http://shermanleung.com/blog/why-ka/">similar decision</a> I came to last year.</p>

<h3 id="1scalingimpactinhealthcare">1. Scaling Impact in Healthcare</h3>

<p>This was a criteria that set the stage early for my search this summer. Before anything else, our quality of life depends on our well-being and I've always been interested in healthcare as a means to increase the bottom line for our collective well-being. Technology, to me, became a tool to scale this impact and I became uniquely drawn about the space of digital health over the past two years.</p>

<p>That being said, there are quite a few digital health companies out there - so why Mango Health specifically? I was compelled by their mission to leverage technology to ultimately encourage more healthy lifestyles. They had a unique approach leveraging gamification that appealed to my interests in mobile technologies. Also, the team itself was a reflection of the leverage that initially drew me to digital health - a small team (&lt; 20) working on a meaningful problem that affects millions of people.</p>

<h3 id="2productengineering">2. Product + Engineering</h3>

<p>Working at Khan Academy inspired me to think critically about product strategy at technology-based companies.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do we build what we build? How do we settle on prioritizing and rolling out product features? How does our product ultimately impact the users that use it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These questions ultimately inspired me to consider a degree in Management Science &amp; Engineering (concentrating in Technology + Engineering Management), and I was looking for an opportunity to help me develop the intuition behind answer some of the above questions. As an engineer, I still wanted the opportunity to hone skills in building product, but I also wanted to explore this intersection of product + engineering - one that was more loosely defined and more open at the smaller companies that I was considering.</p>

<p>Mango was willing to take the risk of offering me an opportunity to dive deep into this intersection of product + engineering by investing in an intern that didn't necessarily know how to contribute in this particular way. </p>

<h3 id="3thenonnegotiables">3. The non-negotiables</h3>

<p>The most memorable interview experience that I had throughout this entire process was a question that Caitlin (Mango's VP of Ops) posed to me:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"What are your 5 non-negotiables?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This struck for two reasons: 1) it sparked an honest and intentional conversation about whether Mango Health could deliver on those non-negotiables 2) it inspired me to think critically about what I was looking for this coming summer and realize that a lot of these things weren't necessarily going to be directly handed to me - I had to ask and look for it!</p>

<p>In retrospect, this was a question that I had thought about despite not clearly articulating my reasons. However, the fact that Mango put just as much thought into this decision - what they could and could not deliver - gave me a good indication of how intentional they were about making sure they could offer me what I'm looking for.</p>

<h3 id="4kpcbrockhealth">4. KPCB/RockHealth</h3>

<p>There's an exciting opportunity inherent in joining a small company backed by two venture capital firms I highly respect. In addition to having their vote of confidence in the team at Mango, they also provided unique opportunities to interns in their portfolio companies. The <a href="http://kpcbfellows.com">KPCB fellowship</a> and RockHealth's <a href="https://rockhealth.com/meet-summer-digital-health-interns/">digital health programming</a> were both compelling invitations to join communities full of like-minded people who care about making an impact with technology.</p>

<p>These communities were a distinct alternative to the "intern classes" I was used to at previous companies, but also an invitation to be directly "mentored by executives" while exploring a field that I've grown to be so excited about. (Having <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronrossbrown">a</a> <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cguan2/">few</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wang-93088533">friends</a> that have vouched for the KPCB program didn't hurt either!)</p>

<p>All in all, I'm incredibly excited about this next step in my journey and thank everyone who's supported me along the way!</p>
